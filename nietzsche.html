        <h1>Friedrich Nietzsche</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Friedrich_Nietzsche_1882.jpg/220px-Friedrich_Nietzsche_1882.jpg" alt="Friedrich Nietzsche">
        <p>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.</p>
        
        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Nietzsche was born in Röcken, Saxony, Prussia. He suffered from poor health throughout his life, which led to his resignation from his academic position in 1879. He spent the last decade of his life in isolation, cared for by his sister Elisabeth, who later edited his works. Nietzsche died in 1900 from a stroke.</p>
        
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Nietzsche's philosophy is characterized by his critique of traditional morality, religion, and culture. He is known for concepts such as the "will to power," the "eternal recurrence," and the "Übermensch" (overman). He proclaimed "God is dead," arguing that the decline of religious belief would lead to nihilism unless new values were created.</p>
        <p>His work influenced existentialism, postmodernism, and various other fields. Nietzsche's ideas were controversial and have been misinterpreted, often associated with fascism, though he himself was critical of nationalism and anti-Semitism.</p>
        
        <h2>Famous Book: Thus Spoke Zarathustra</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra.jpg/220px-Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra.jpg" alt="Thus Spoke Zarathustra">
        <p><em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None</em> (1883–1885) is Nietzsche's most famous work, written in four parts. It is a philosophical novel that uses the character Zarathustra (inspired by the Persian prophet Zoroaster) to convey Nietzsche's ideas.</p>
        <p>The book explores themes of the Übermensch, the will to power, and the eternal recurrence. Zarathustra descends from his mountain to share his wisdom with humanity, proclaiming the death of God and the need for individuals to create their own values. It is written in a poetic, aphoristic style and has been influential in literature and philosophy.</p>
        <p>Summary: The narrative follows Zarathustra's journey, his teachings on self-overcoming, and his encounters with various characters symbolizing human conditions. It culminates in the idea that life must be affirmed in all its aspects, including suffering, to achieve true freedom.</p>
